Don't let the pressure get to your head
You know we play for keeps
Don't let it go over your head
Heavy stepper, I got too much weight on this
You can see the diamonds, don't complain on this (me)
We was hustling, you n- got no say on this (no)
I'm just being honest
I'm moving steady (shoot)
You can't buy success, ain't got no sale on it
You know that God did, he never gon' fail on us
